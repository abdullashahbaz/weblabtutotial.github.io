Week 3 report form

APPORACH: I first made the form.html page which had the HTML strcuture for the form I linked this html page to the index.js JavaScript was used to handle the interaction between the CTA button and the form. The CTA button click event triggers the display of the form and hides the button. and also the how things wouldbe inputted and how will we get the errors at the end i linked the cta button in index.html to form.html

CHALLENGES FACED

Implementing validation for different fields and updating the visual feedback was another challenge. Managing error messages and success states required careful JavaScript coding.

challenge i faced was when i clicked the cta button it didnt trigger anything

And when I got the cta linked to the form and clicked the cta button it then opened the form html but that page also had the cta button and when I click it then only the input page opened

HOW I OVERCAME

I made changes to the js file so i get errors and the input were right

in order for the cta button to trigger the form when clicked i directed it to the form file so thag its opens the forms which inturn was linked to the js file

in the html file for the form I had also mentioned the link for the cta button thatâ€™s why one more cta button was coming I removed the cta button and only mention the input form

APPROACH I first changed the banner section to the thing that was sent on mail

Then I made a js file Which had a counter (i) then i made a list of all the photos

Then i made a function change image In this function the i made such that the counter value changes so that i can use that counter to access the list of images and then change the images

Then i set an interval that runs the function after every set time

CHALLENGES The first thing was how to make the function run after every fixed time

Then when i ran the page then the images we not appearing properly some where blurred and some where positioned out

HOW I OVERCAME For the function to run after fixed time i used setInterval function

For the images i changed some of the images that were getting blurred and made changes to the CSS
